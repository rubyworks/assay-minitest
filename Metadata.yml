  Assay MiniTest

summary:
  MiniTest on Assay

description:
  Assay MiniTest defines a set of MiniTest-compatible assertion and extension
  methods which seemlessly delegate to Assay assertions. This allows developers
  to change test frameworks without having to completely rewrite a slew of
  previously written MiniTest-based tests and/or sepcifications.
